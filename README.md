# Blazor.Window
A Blazor wrapper for the [Window interface from the HTML Specification.](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-window-object)
This interface standardizes methods for controlling the global object used in browser windows called `Window`. This project implements a wrapper around the interface and its types for Blazor so that we can easily and safely work with all the method, attributes, and events surfaced as a part of the `Window` interface.

These functionalities are vast and we do not wish to support them all as some of them have little use or work against the principles of Blazor. Here I have made a high-level list of the different functionalities that the `Window` interface supply and marked which this wrapper will cover.

- ðŸš« Access to the top level `Document` of the window.
- âœ… Navigation control for the window.
- âœ… Option to register WebComponents using the `CustomElementRegistry`.
- ðŸš« Attributes indicating whether toolbar, scrollbars, location bar, etc. are visible.
- âœ… Access to the parent `WindowProxy` that this window is hosted in/by in case it is in an iframe or is a pop-up window.
- âœ… Option to open a new window given some URL and target.
- ðŸš« Attributes giving information about the user agent through the `Navigator`.
- âœ… Initialize alert, confirm, prompt, and print user prompts.
- âœ… Posting messages to the window itself and listening for messages sent to this window.
- âœ… Event listeners for events that are triggered when the user interacts with the window like mouse click, scroll, resize, etc.
- âœ… Event listeners for events related to the actions available in the window like changes in internet connectivity, changes in navigation location, or when the page is shown or hidden.

**This wrapper is still being scoped so actual development has not been started.**
